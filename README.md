# UITestSample

A simple repository to do some tests using App Center UI Test and Xamarin.UITest versions.

## Instructions

Install App Center CLI https://github.com/microsoft/appcenter-cli.

Run `sh test.sh` to build all the projects and prepare the tests. If you prepare the tests using `Xamarin.UITest` 4.0.1 version a problem happens. If you use version 3.2.9 the preparation process is finished.
